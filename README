RBQ is a simple Ruby script that populates a Rhythmbox "Play Queue" with a semi-random list of
songs from your library. Songs you've rated higher in Rhythmbox and songs that haven't been played
much are more likely to get added than those rated lower or played more often. RBQ will
also make sure that multiple tracks by the same artist are sufficietly spread apart in the queue.

* Only songs that have been given at least one star will be chosen.
* Don't run while Rhythmbox is running. Shut down Rhythmbox first, run RBQ, then restart Rhythmbox.
	Otherwise, Rhythmbox will just overwrite any changes that RBQ makes.
